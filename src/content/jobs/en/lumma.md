I developed and designed interactive web applications for a Set-Top Box (STB). The main challenge was to create an intuitive and user-friendly navigation, given that all user interactions are performed through a remote control. My focus was on adapting functionalities and the user interface to the remote control, optimizing controls and buttons for seamless interaction. Additionally, I worked on the appealing design of the applications and closely collaborated with the development team to ensure their optimal performance on the Set-Top Box.
